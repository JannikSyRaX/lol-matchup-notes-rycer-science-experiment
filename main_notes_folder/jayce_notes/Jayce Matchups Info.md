# General
## Laning Overview
- strong lvl1-5 due to having twice the abilities and being ranged
- easy to gank especially if rE, R, and/or Phaserush are on CD
- snowballs quickly, you really don't want to give him a single kill
- Jayce basically can't play if he has a minion disadvantage (XP down, more ally minions to block his rQ) so try to trade HP for minion damage at lvl1, this also means you should never leash
## Enemy Abilities
- remember that he can't swap forms at will; if he swaps, he can't access the other form's abilities for a while which is especially impactful if he switches without having used his abilities
- try to deal your burst damage when he is in ranged form since melee form gives him resists
- at lvl2 his QE doesn't deal much damage but costs a lot of mana, try to bait it out and even if you get hit it's usually good for you
- always look out for Jayce QE angles when you take CS or recall
## Items, Runes, Summoner's, Skill Order
- has a lot of burst damage especially with Dirk, so buy defensive items early

# Aatrox
## Laning Overview
- early is rough; he beats you for free lvl1-5, you will sit under tower a lot
- lvl6 is your powerspike but it only makes the all-in ~50/50
## Specific Laning Actions
- try to stall the first crash by AAing and Qing the wave as much as you can -> can also convert this into a gank
- you need to deplete his mana bar by baiting and dodging Qs
- abuse low mana
- try to freeze whenever you can, but probably happens rarely -> Jayce is easily gankable and you can run him down when he fucks up
## Ability Usage
- treat your W almost as if it doesn't exist; he has too many MS bonuses to move out of it
- use Q2 during Melee E knockback to hit it
- be very careful with forward EQ's, if you miss you lose a lot of HP
## Enemy Abilities
- if you time Q2 correctly you can cancel his mQ which instantly wins you the trade
## Items, Runes, Summoner's, Skill Order
- defensive items early; DShield, Phage, Steelcaps
- if you are very ahead you can go Duskblade and oneshot him in ranged form
- double AS runes good for early levels and extra damage in all-ins
- Comet and Conqueror both good, prefer Conqueror
- lvl3 2 points Q is good because you need the waveclear and can't hit W on him most likely

# Darius
## Laning Overview
- footsies (/ spacing) are very important, you can get quite close to him especially early
## Specific Laning Actions
- can cheese lvl1, and kind of need to to do anything in lane early, it's mostly a Ghost for HP advantage trade but can be extended into a kill if Jayce is greedy -> could start DBlade to make this stronger
## Ability Usage
- never use E before he uses mQ (unless you get a kill or big damage guaranteed) or you get punished hard
## Enemy Abilities
- abuse downtimes of rE and form swap, without his MS bursts he is vulnerable
- if you play vs Phaserush you have to respect the rune and try to bait it out, because it denies you a lot of opportunities if it's available
## Items, Runes, Summoner's, Skill Order
- rush Steelcaps for tankiness and movement speed; don't need damage to 100-0 him anyway
- then Phage for sustain
- if you have a rough lane, you can go Steelcaps + Warden's and auto-win, but it makes you worse in teamfights, susceptible to AP mid/jungle in ganks or skirmishes, and delays your powerspike

# Jax
## Laning Overview
- get early pressure, your E is broken with proper footsies
- if you don't contest early and get pushed in it's rough but you can all-in at lvl3 when waves meet
- your lvl6 is strong if you are even
- you got good gank setup by either hitting your E or making him use both E's and Phaserush
- play defensively if you go 0/1 or the lane can snowball out of control
## Specific Laning Actions
- scout lvl1 ability with as little risk as possible -> be aware that Jayce can theoretically skill E and kite you hard lvl1
- give up ranged minions at turret to stay healthy
## Enemy Abilities
- try to make him use mQ and/or mE first, or camp bush when he uses it for CS, and then Q in; also works when he recently swapped forms
## Items, Runes, Summoner's, Skill Order
- Grasp good
- can take Manaflow + Scorch and spam Qs as tech for this matchup
- otherwise Inspiration with Cookies
- usually go E start, can also go Q start especially when he's late to lane and you can stack your Grasp and can't get in range for E, but you can't do it vs Conq
- need to try out Steelcaps rush; I think you can beat him easily at lvl6 but haven't seen it in videos
- buy at least Cloth Armour early so you don't get oneshot when he has Dirk

# Yone
## Laning Overview
- the matchup is really hard at pro level
- Jayce can't kill you if you don't play aggressively (and misplay)
- if you fall behind it's really hard to come back especially pre-6
## Specific Laning Actions
- lvl1 is rough so play passively and don't use Q3 into him at max range
- lvl2 you can poke with W but still need to be careful
- you lose all-in at lvl2 if Conq Jayce
- lvl3 you have lots of pressure on him; can already all-in him if you played lvl2 aggressively and he doesn't respect it
## Items, Runes, Summoner's, Skill Order
- rush Berserker's to gapclose and sidestep better
- Second Wind preferred over Boneplating, but both work
## Enemy Abilities
- Conq Jayce is worse for you than Phaserush
## Ability Usage
- can use E to dodge QE at lvl5+
